## Starting From Scratch                                                        
                                                                                
### üö¶ A Quick Note About Workflows                                             
                                                                                
> To start from scratch, the remote repository you intend to use should be      
empty.If your remote repository is non-empty (even if the only contents are a   
single README file), then I recommend skipping to the                           
[Migrating to a New System](#migrating-to-a-new-system) section. The workflows  
are similar (and I promise you won't miss out on any important details), but in 
the migration section I cover how to deal with file conflicts; a topic not      
covered in this section since the remote repository is assumed to be empty.     
                                                                                
The first step to managing your dotfiles is to create a bare repository and     
establish an alias for working with it.                                         
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
git init --bare $HOME/.dotfiles                                                 
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'      
```                                                                             
                                                                                
Next, hide untracked files and prevent adding the repository to itself.         
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no                            
echo ".dotfiles" >> $HOME/.gitignore                                            
```                                                                             
                                                                                
Lastly, add a remote so that your local branch is tracked remotely.             
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
dotfiles remote add origin <git-repo-url>                                       
```                                                                             
                                                                                
### üçæ You're Done                                                              

Now your dotfiles repository is ready for use. I suggest adding the alias to    
your `.bashrc` file so that it is present for future session.  

## Using the Dotfiles Alias                                                              
                                                                                
We can demo the dotfiles alias by adding the `.gitignore` file we either created
or modified during the setup:                                                   
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
dotfiles add .gitignore                                                         
dotfiles status                                                                 
dotfiles commit -m "Added gitignore."                                           
dotfiles push                                                                   
```

## Migrating to a New System                                                    
                                                                                
To migrate your existing dotfiles repository to a new system, clone a bare      
repository for your remote repository and establish an alias for working with   
it.                                                                             
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/.dotfiles                                 
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'      
```                                                                             
                                                                                
Next, hide untracked files and prevent adding the repository to itself.         
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no                            
echo ".dotfiles" >> $HOME/.gitignore                                            
```                                                                             
                                                                                
Then, use the alias to checkout your dotfiles in your `$HOME` directory.        
                                                                                
```bash                                                                         
dotfiles checkout                                                               
```                                                                             
                                                                                
### ‚ö†Ô∏è File Conflicts

> If current files on your system conflict with those being checked out, then   
you will get a warning about untracked working tree files being overwritten. To 
resolve this, rename each of those files to some non-conflicting name or move   
them to a backup directory. When I encounter this warning message I move all    
conflicting files to a `.dotfiles.bak` directory so that the files no longer    
pose a conflict and are contained within a single directory that is easy to     
manage. Below is the simple command that I use to automate this process.        
>```bash                                                                        
>mkdir -p .dotfiles.bak \                                                       
>   && dotfiles checkout 2>&1 | egrep "^\s+" | awk {'print $1'} | xargs -I {} mv
>   && dotfiles checkout                                                        
>```                                                                            
                                                                                
### üçæ You're Done                                                              
                                                                                
Now your dotfiles repository is ready for use. Don't forget to specify your     
upstream branch on your first push (e.g., `dotfiles push -u origin master`)! If 
you do not have the dotfiles alias in you `.bashrc` already, then I suggest     
adding it so that the alias is present for future session.
